- auth - no import in the example
- auth - explain what strategy to return (it is not clear that you need to create passport strategy)
- See the Hacker News example project for the full code. - no link to the example
- for example, passport-google or passport-facebook. - there are no such modules.
- why create strategy does not create strategy, but creates some weird object?
- we need base url for various redirect config for auth, but it is hardcoded in the brewcomputer - is it a way to get it somehow?
- Ctrl+C does not show clear command prompt
- it is not clear what options to pass to the strategy (http://www.passportjs.org/docs/google/), but no callback function... It would be good to make it clear.
- auth - no info in the docs what to write in the callback.
- Error: The "default" read model connector is specified but no read model/saga uses it - why this is an error?
- readModelConnectors: - why it is not an array?
- it is not clear that `path: 'login'` in the auth module config means `/api/login`
